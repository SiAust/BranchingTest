 # BranchingTest
 This repository is a test to explore version control on Github.
 I will create a repository, 
 create a local branch, commit changes
 to the branch, push to Github, create a pull request
 and merge into the master branch. This will be completed
 using the Git terminal commands in InteliJ IDEA IDE.
 ### Created FirstBranch
 This is and all below, are changes added to FirstBranch branch.
 ### Some further tasks to explore
 - [ ] Update a local repository with changes from a remote repo
 - [ ] Fork an interesting repository
 - [X] Renaming a branch following naming conventions
 - [ ] Deleting a remote branch
 - [ ] More to come...
 
 ### Some useful Git tips
 - `git remote remove <name>` if you make an error in the URL you can remove
 reference and add the correct address using `git remote origin <URL>`
 - `git add *.java` adds all java files in the current working directory
 to the staging area ready to be committed.
 - `git clone <URL>` copies (clones) a repository from a URL.
 - In console commands use the command name followed by `-help` to
 see the options.
    - `[]` elements are optional
    - `<>` elements are required
- `git branch -m <oldname> <newname>` to rename a local branch
    - `git branch -m <newname>` rename current branch
- `git branch` shows all branches and currently active branch
