 # BranchingTest
 This repository is a test to explore version control on Github.
 I will create a repository, 
 create a local branch, commit changes
 to the branch, push to Github, create a pull request
 and merge into the master branch. This will be completed
 using the Git terminal commands in InteliJ IDEA IDE.

 ### Some further tasks to explore
 - [X] Update a local repository with changes from a remote repo
 - [X] Fork an interesting repository
 - [X] Renaming a branch following naming conventions
 - [X] Deleting a remote branch
 - [X] Merging a branch locally and remotely
 - [ ] More to come...
