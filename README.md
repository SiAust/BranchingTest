 # BranchingTest
 This repository is a test to explore version control on Github.
 I will create a repository, 
 create a local branch, commit changes
 to the branch, push to Github, create a pull request
 and merge into the master branch. This will be completed
 using the Git terminal commands in InteliJ IDEA IDE."
 ## Created FirstBranch

 ### Some further tasks to explore
 - [ ] Update local repo with changes from a remote repo

 - [ ] More to come...
 
 ### Some useful tips
 1. `git remote remove <name>` if you make an error in the URL you can remove
 reference and add the correct address using `git remote origin <URL>`
 2. `git add *.java` adds all java files in the current working directory
 to the staging area ready to be committed.
 3. `git clone <URL>` copies (clones) a repository from a URL.
